# droxytools

This is a collection of droxy tools I configured on my local machine.

**if you are intersted in how it works:**
# [install droxy](https://github.com/Oppodelldog/droxy/releases)
# Ensure droxy is available in your PATH.
# Just call ```droxy clones``` 

Now you have clones of droxy created.

Those commands are in fact copies of droxy, but they behave as defined in **droxy.toml** configuration.

**have fun**
